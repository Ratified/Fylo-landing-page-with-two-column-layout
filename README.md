## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution for a challenge from Front End Mentor. Front End mentor offers challenges that help developers improve their coding skills by building realistic projects.
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

# Overview

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this fylo landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The layout was also supposed to be able to adapt to different screen sizes

The users should be able to: 
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page



## Built with these technologies
Semantic HTML 5 MarkUp

CSS custom properties

CSS Grid

CSS Flexbox
